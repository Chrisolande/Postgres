PostgreSQL Exercises

This project contains my practice exercises in PostgreSQL. After spending a long time working with MySQL, I’m using these datasets to learn PostgreSQL from the ground up.

The exercises are based on concepts and examples from the books Just Use Postgres! and PostgreSQL Mistakes and How to Avoid Them (Manning Publications). They focus on exploring datasets, writing queries, and understanding PostgreSQL-specific features and best practices.
